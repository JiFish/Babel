Clement Clarke Moore
The night before Christmas
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;\nThe stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\nIn hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,\nWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;\nAnd mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,\nHad just settled down for a long winter's nap,\nWhen out on the
lawn there arose such a clatter,\nI sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.\nAway to the window I flew like a flash,\nTore open the shutters and threw up the sash.\nThe moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,\nWhen, what to my wondering eyes should appear,\nBut a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,\nWith a little old driver, so lively and quick,\nI knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,\nAnd he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;\n"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!\nOn, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!\nTo the top of the
porch! to the top of the wall!\nNow dash away! dash away! dash away all!"\nAs dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,\nWhen they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,\nSo up to the house-top the coursers they
flew,\nWith the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.\nAnd then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\nThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.\nAs I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\nHe was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,\nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;\nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\nAnd he looked like
a peddler just opening his pack.\nHis eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!\nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\nAnd the beard of his chin was as white
as the snow;\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\nAnd the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly,\nThat shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.\nHe was chubby and
plump, a right jolly old elf,\nAnd I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;\nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head,\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,\nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose,\nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\nAnd away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\n"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."
