        "There once was a miner named Dave, who dug too close to the lava's hot wave. His pickaxe did slip, he took a quick dip, now he's trapped in a fiery grave.",
        "A creeper snuck up by the rush, whose sizzle made young Steve yell ‘Hush!’. With TNT cubes, he is not amused, but in battle, he turns all to dust!",
        "The iron golem stood tall, guarding the village from all. With vines in his hand, he patrols the land, while enemies face his brute fall.",
        "A spider, it climbed on the wall, giving poor Alex a frightful call. With eight eyes unseen, it weaves a web sheen, until sunlight brings its downfall."
