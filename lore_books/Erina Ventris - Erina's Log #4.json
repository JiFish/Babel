        "The journey in the Overworld ends here. Reflection steals the night; have I forgotten anything? I whisper to the stars about courage and resolve.",
        "I’m ready. Bid my friends farewell, and stepped through. The End Portal stands before me, shimmering. Potions are ready. My bow is enchanted.",
        "I hear my heartbeat. Will anyone remember my name? I’ll step through now. Wish me luck. The End. It's empty, barren, suffocating.",
        "Obsidian towers reach to the void. Beacons of power. Endermen are everywhere, but I look away. The dragon circles above. It begins."
