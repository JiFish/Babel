        "Phantoms, ethereal wraiths descending upon the insomniac. They haunt the skies, a nightly terror to those who forsake slumber. Their cries cut the night air.",
        "Phantoms linger above, swooping with malevolent grace. Their gaunt visage is more ethereal than corporeal, yet their talons cut all the same.",
        "Secure rest averts their wrath. Barring that, direct engagement requires vigilance. Their circling flight pattern reveals their attack vector.",
        "In combat, patience prevails. Strike when they dive, grounded momentarily. Their hides yield membranes of curious utility, worth the trial of pursuit."
