        "Crafting a map requires both paper and the precious compass. A map begins blank but fills as areas are explored.",
        "Understanding scale is vital. A map covers an area of 128x128 blocks and can be expanded up to several times.",
        "Item frames can display maps or mark important locations. Envision an atlas of interconnected framed maps as a legacy.",
        "Maps do not update naturally; new journeys require new maps. Regularly record changes, especially in villages and forests.",
        "Locked maps are invaluable when depicting history or preserving delicate landscapes. Duplicate maps with a cartography table.",
        "A skilled cartographer always shares their discoveries. Leave map copies in libraries or with traveling merchants."
