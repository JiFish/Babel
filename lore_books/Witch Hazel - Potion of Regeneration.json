        "So you wish for life unending? Brew the Potion of Regeneration for ceaseless vitality!",
        "Start, as all good potions do, with the Awkward Potion base. Gather a ghast tear for healing's core.",
        "To the Nether, with its ghastly inhabitants, go forth bravely to procure their sorrowful tears.",
        "Back at thy brewing stand, introduce the tear into the potion, letting it ripple with renewed life.",
        "Patience, patience. Transformation is delicate as life. As it finishes, hold the power to heal over time!",
