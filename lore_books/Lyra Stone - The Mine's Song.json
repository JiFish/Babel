        "Beneath the earth, silent and deep, I hear whispers in caverns, secrets to keep. Echoes of miners, long passed through here, resonate softly, sweet music so clear.",
        "The pickaxe strikes in rhythmic dance, shaping the tunnels with every chance. Each block that falls sings its verse, adding to stories both blessed and cursed.",
        "Coal and gems, hidden and bright, twinkle like stars in the cloak of night. Their luster shines with tales untold, of ancient miners and fortunes bold.",
        "Let us listen to the mine's sighs, in its heart where the stillness lies. For every stone has a story to share, in the whispers that linger in the air."
