        "Skeletons are archers of chilling precision. Rattling bones herald their presence, yet in shadows, even this can be masked. Beware their calculating assault.",
        "Distance is their domain. They launch arrows with unerring aim, often retreating to maintain advantage. Natural obstacles become their accomplices.",
        "In conflict, close the gap with swiftness. Shields repel their barrages, while calculated advances bring you to their hollowed form.",
        "Their bones collect well. Their bows, worn but serviceable. Aim to catch these archers in dawn’s light; they disintegrate under the sun’s harsh gaze."
