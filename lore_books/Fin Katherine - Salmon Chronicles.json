        "Salmon, they prefer them swift currents and cold waters, swimming upstream.",
        "Best caught in rivers or oceans, where they're most active and the waters dance with their silvery forms.",
        "Cook 'em for a healthy meal to stave off hunger on long journeys.",
        "The cooked salmon restores more hunger, a bannerman's choice fer a grand adventure.",
        "Smart and slippery, the salmon won't be snagged by just any ol' hook, mark my words."
