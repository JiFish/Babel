        "There was a whispering in the deep mine, a chilling voice that echoed amidst the rocks. Miners claimed it was just the wind, but there were rumors about souls trapped below.",
        "One moonless night, a miner named Jack ventured deeper than ever before. He had heard tales of untold riches, but he didn't believe in the legends of cursed spirits.",
        "As he descended further, Jack could hear eerie moans echoing through the darkness. He told himself it was the mine creaking, but cold shivers ran down his spine.",
        "Suddenly, the ground trembled, and ghostly figures emerged from the walls. They were translucent, their faces twisted with sorrow and rage, eyes locked onto Jack.",
        "The figures clutched at him with icy hands, pulling him into the stone as he screamed. The mine silenced once more; Jack became just another whisper.",
        "Days later, the mine was sealed, but sometimes at night, if you press your ear to the rocks, you can still hear Jack's screams trapped in the stone."
