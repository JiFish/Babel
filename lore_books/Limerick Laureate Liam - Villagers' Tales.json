        "There lived a wise villager, Brew, whose potions invariably grew. A potion of flight, made his day quite light; winged sandals he wished he outgrew!",
        "Our farmer liked carrots and lots, with veggies growing in crops. He’d wake at sunrise, to appease the skies, whilst dreaming of golden bushels’ sops.",
        "A merchant stood tall at the gate, trading goods at a steady rate. With emeralds to spare, assets to share, for leather and more, a fair trait.",
        "A librarian, a scholar of books, skims through pages with curious looks. Enchanted by lore, vast knowledge to pour, his wisdom inside is what hooks."
