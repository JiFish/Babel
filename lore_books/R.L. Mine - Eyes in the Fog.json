        "A dense fog enveloped the seaside village each night, and within it dwelled unseen horrors. Locals spoke of eyes watching them from the mist.",
        "Mark didn't believe in the fog's curse; he laughed at the villagers' fears. But he would soon become a believer.",
        "One evening, Mark wandered too near the shore. The fog rolled in like a living entity, thick and suffocating, blotting out the stars.",
        "The air buzzed with ominous energy as he pushed forward, his bravado fading with each step. Shapes began to swim in the mist, indistinct yet menacing.",
        "Glowing eyes surrounded him, piercing through the fog with unnerving clarity. Whispers filled his mind: promises of madness and despair.",
        "As Mark's laughter turned to terrified cries, the fog swallowed him whole. The village learned to heed the eyes' silent warnings, lest they vanish too."
