        "The Nether is a place of fire and lava. Beware of the ghasts that float ominously. Their fireballs can ruin your day.",
        "Piglins are quite the characters. Offering them gold may save your hide. Just remember, never open chests near them.",
        "Basalt Deltas are treacherous. The ground is uneven and lava hugs the edges. Ghasts have a bird's-eye view here.",

        "Nether Quartz is a peaceful find. It glistens in the netherrack. Experience gained is a worthy reward."
