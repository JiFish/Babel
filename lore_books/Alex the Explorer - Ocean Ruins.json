        "Beneath the waves lie ocean ruins, remnants of an age subsumed by the sea. Crafted in stone and coral.",
        "These eerie structures house the drowned, guardians of secrets and treasures alike.",
        "What tales would they tell? Broken stone and scattered loot hint at past lives and struggles.",
        "The ruins often yield treasures: enchanted fishing rods, lapis lazuli, and sea-themed artifacts.",
        "Exploring these ruins is perilous. Ocean currents pull, and drowned defend fiercely.",
        "Yet, each submerged expedition teaches more of an ancient world swallowed whole. Dive deep, explorer!"
