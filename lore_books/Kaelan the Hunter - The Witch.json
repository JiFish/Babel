        "Witches, cunning practitioners of the dark arts. They reside within huts nestled in swamps, surrounded by an eerie tranquility that belies danger.",
        "Armed with potions of harm and deception, they seize advantage from confusion and chaos. Antidotes and preparation are your allies.",
        "In battle, disrupt their concoctions with speed. Sharp strikes disarm their brew, while ranged assaults limit exposure to their noxious poisons.",
        "Victory promises a variety of alchemical components. Handle with careâ€”each potion, a potential boon or an unforeseen curse."
