        "The desert is vast, hot, and dry, with sand dunes that seem almost shy. But hidden within, are temples akin, to fortune or doom, do not deny.",
        "A tundra lies frozen and chill, where wolves roam the snow without ill. Furs bristling in cold, their loyalty bold, when trekking the vastness is the skill.",
        "In a jungle, green and ornate, lush vines form an emeraldy gait. With cocoa beans scone, and ocelots known, it swaps calm for jollity's pate!",
        "The ocean is vast and so deep, where treasure and mermaidens seep. From shore to abyss, at dolphins' sweet kiss, the sailors' hearts continue to leap."
