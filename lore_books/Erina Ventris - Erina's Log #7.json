        "Nearing the final strike, my journey’s symbol. The End looms large in stories past and gone. I balance between destiny and oblivion.",
        "Strength finds me, forged in fire and dreams. This is it. My final entry. The dragon hit me as I climbed. I fell.",
        "I threw a pearl, but it missed the ledge. I’m falling… into the void. Tell my story. Finish the fight. For me."
