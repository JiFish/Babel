        "Zombies, shambling remnants of humankind. Driven by a primal hunger, their approach is relentless. By day, harmless—at night, tenacious combatants.",
        "These creatures operate in numbers, their unity their sole tactic. Their keen interest in villagers speaks of a remnant past, a haunting echo.",
        "In their presence, fortifications serve best. Yet, if on open terrain, dispatching them one by one quickly stems the tide of their insistent approach.",
        "Armored or unarmored, they fall equally to blade and flame. Their defeat leaves behind flesh—a grim token. The wise hunter never leaves them unburned."
