        "Ghasts, the mournful giants roaming the Nether skies. Their cries echo endlessly, both a warning and a lament. Their vast size belies a fragile nature.",
        "When provoked, they launch fiery volleys that devastate terrain. Evasion is paramount, for standing ground means certain doom.",
        "Return fire with precisionâ€”a well-placed arrow ends their haunting. Should melee be required, proximity to a portal is advisable for swift retreat.",
        "Their tears, valuable and rare, make the hunt profitable. It is a delicate balance: overcome their might without being overwhelmed by fire."
