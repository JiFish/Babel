        "Radical idea—build a mansion! Dream big, right? Laid the foundations, framed it up, boy was it coming together.",
        "Architecture took me months! Pillars tall like giraffes and hallways stretchin' on for days. Felt like a king in his castle.",
        "Last block in place and... Wow! Stood back. Waitaminute. Something's off. I stared in disbelief!",
        "My lofty ceiling was oddly low, turns out I'm one block off on every measurement. Ruined!",
        "Who would've figured one measly block could spoil the whole kit and caboodle? Learned that the hard way, hasn't left my mind since.",
        "Remember: Measure twice, build once, and don't let excitement overtake precision. Or you might end up havin’ to crouch in your own mansion."
