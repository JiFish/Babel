        "Tunnels echo secrets older than the End. Stand at crossroads, shout your heart's desire.",
        "Walls may chant back wisdom, but be sure to have a book of silk spider written spells with you.",
        "Echos carry promises of the past if you exchange them with laughter stored in glass bottles.",
        "Invisible villagers dwell in echoes, trading only rumors of emerald trees.",
        "If asked about the moon, whisper only truths wrapped in moonflower petals. Then play invisible walls as instruments."
