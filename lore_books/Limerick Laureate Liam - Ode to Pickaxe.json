        "Steve cherished a pickaxe of stone, which helped him avoid lava moan. He swapped it for iron, when the wear was tirin', now ore he can swiftly dethrone.",
        "The shovel, a trusted old friend, made earth and sand quick to rend. But with a strong spade, no time is delayed; one swift swoop and dirt is no trend.",
        "While mining, a delight was found—diamonds glimmer in the underground. Not a trace was wasted, as riches are tasted—Steve's a legend in this mining ground.",
        "A lone axe splits wood with style, chopping forest for blocks in a while. Its rhythm in hand, brings wood up grand, for builds that expand mile by mile."
