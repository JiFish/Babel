        "A zombie in armor drew near, filling wandering hearts with sheer drear. But covered in gear, it built up great fear, as moans mingled with the moon's leer.",
        "A skeleton aimed with great speed, its arrow just missing the reed. It took a step back, to gather its knack, then tension in its bow did it heed.",
        "The Enderman stalked in the night, bringing terror at a mere sight. Holding a block, whilst performing a stalk, it vanished from view with fluid might.",
        "A great ghast up high in the air, floating freely without a care. Its fireballs alight, bring fear to the night, as adventurers flee its despair."
